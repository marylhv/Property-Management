# 3F Properties Database Project

## Overview
This project was completed as part of **INMT 342** at the University of Tennessee.  
Our team designed and implemented a relational database system for a fictional company, *3F Properties*.  
The database supports property management tasks such as tracking owners, tenants, rental agreements, repairs, maintenance, and financial activities.

## Features
- Complete SQL schema with over 20 relational tables  
- Populated database with sample data (owners, properties, tenants, loans, repairs, etc.)  
- Query library with views and joins to generate reports for:  
  - Property repair and maintenance costs  
  - Late fees by tenant  
  - Current leases and days until expiration  
  - Sold property profiles and profitability  
  - Potential property profiles and owner details  
  - Purchase order and supplier reports  
- Conceptual model, logical data model, and data dictionary  

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server** (DDL & DML scripts)  
- Relational database design principles  
- ER modeling  

## My Role
This was a group project. My contributions included:  
- Writing and testing SQL queries and views (maintenance/repair history, tenant late fee tracking)  
- Contributing to the database documentation and data dictionary  
- Assisting with schema design and validation  

## Team Members
